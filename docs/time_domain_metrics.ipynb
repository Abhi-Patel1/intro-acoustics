    "# Time Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "The time domain refers to the perspective where a sound is viewed as a waveform, which is simply a changing pressure over a period of time. There are many ways to describe the qualities, especially strength, of a waveform. This section provides a simple overview of some of these metrics, their theoretical basis, and how to calculate them in matlab. The final portion provides some hands-on examples for how to apply these metrics, and hopefully demonstrates that metrics must be chosen carefully, as not all metrics are appropriate for all signals."

You can also change the type of signal generated in the `create signal` section. To do that, you'll need to uncomment (i.e., remove the `%`) the required line(s). Almost all the signals with the exception of the pulsetrain can be generated with a one-line function. The `chirp` signal is shown by default.\n",

    "\n",
    "All the metrics presented previously allow the description of signals within the time domain according to your purpose. \n",
    "To choose appropriately the metrics according to your purpose, it is important to understand how they vary according to the signals’ parameters (*e.g.* duration, amplitude). \n",
    "The **energy** is function of the amplitude and of the duration of the signal (cf. section METRICS). Thus, over a same duration a signal with a higher amplitude will have a higher energy than a signal with a lower amplitude. Conversely, for a given amplitude, an increase of the duration of the signal will also increase the energy. \n",
    "The **power** is the mean energy per unit of time. Therefore, a signal with similar amplitude but with different duration will have the same power. The power will be different if the amplitude of the signal varies. Variations of the values are the same for the **RMS** as it is the square root of the power.\n",
    "The **Zero to peak pressure** and the **Peak to peak pressure** will only vary according to the intensity of the signals, *i.e* with the amplitude of the signal.\n",
    "While assessing the metrics of a **continuous** signal, you will have to fix a duration, this will have consequences on the value of the **energy**. Similarly, when assessing the metrics of a **discrete** signal the precision of the duration will have an impact of the estimation of the **power**. Thus, the measure of the signal of interest should be done carefully.\n"
