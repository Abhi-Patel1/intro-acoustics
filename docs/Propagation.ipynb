    "# Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "The sound is a wave emitted at a given intensity and so with a finite energy. To propagate through a medium as water, the wave sound excites the molecules of its medium to propagate through it. As the excitation requires energy, the sound level decreases as the wave propagates away from the source (*i.e.* distance covered). Besides, the vibration of the molecules within a medium would requires different amount of energy according the viscosity of the medium. Indeed, the wave sound gets absorbed while spreading through the surrounding medium. The whole attenuation of sound intensity, through the geometrical spreading (*i.e* distance covered) and through the absorption, defines the transmission loss and is estimated in decibels (dB).\n"

    "### Geometrical spreading\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometrical spreading is a simple approximation to describe how sound level decreases as a sound wave propagates away from the source. This approach describes the geometry of the wave propagation by considering an omnidirectional spreading. Such model simplify the sound propagation by avoiding the consideration of the refraction occurring because of the dependence of sound speed on depth, for instance. To assess more complex spreading other models based on ray tracing  programs (*e.g.* Bellhop) may be used. However, such programs require in general to know most of the environmental parameters.\n",

    "**!!PLAGIARISM DOSITS but so well written ^^: The amount of absorption depends on the frequency of the sound. A high frequency sound has many cycles in a second, and the particles in the medium are therefore vibrating very rapidly. Just as when you rub your hands together very rapidly, this produces more heat than if you rub your hands together slowly. Since the molecules get their energy to vibrate from the sound wave, the sound wave will run out of energy sooner when it is a high frequency sound. This means that, under the same conditions, a high frequency sound won’t travel as far as a low frequency sound.**"
